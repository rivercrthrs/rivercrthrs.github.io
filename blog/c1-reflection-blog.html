    <h2>Experience vs Entertainment</h2>

    <p>I found Shereef's chat to be very inspiring, it confirmed my choice for choosing EDA over the many other options available to me here in the US as far a dev bootcamps. Something that really resonated with me was his kitchen vs restaurant analogy. I have worked as a band’s tour manager for the last few years and I have so many experiences of people showing up to the show expecting to be spoon fed the music and entertained rather then actually participating in the show, giving their energy and attention to co-create an experience with the band. The musicians I worked with wanted to create an experience with the audience rather then entertain them while they passively consumed the music.</p>
    <p>I’m very excited to be able to code with a partner in order to share our knowledge. I’m hoping it might work out to spend the last month or so of phase 0 with Misha and really stuff/prepare together.</p>
