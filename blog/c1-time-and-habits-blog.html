  <h2>Time + Habits + Motivation</h2>
  <h3></h3>
  <div class="blogpost">
    <p>Time and motivation has always been something I’ve struggled with a lot, especially when it comes to mainly self directed activities. I told myself at the beginning of this week that I would work on my touch typing for 30 minutes each day but after the first two days I didn’t continue. I have found that I’m better organizing my time and sticking to accomplishing my goals when I have a better daily routine and so this is something I plan to work on in the upcoming weeks. I want to work on waking up at a more regular time to start my day, setting clearer goals of what I need to accomplish each and the time I need to accomplish those tasks in. </p>
    <p>A more rhythmic daily routine is the habit I currently need to work on most and a healthy routine will support building more good habits in the future. </p>
